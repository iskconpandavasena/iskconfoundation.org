        <p class="lead">
        
          We are seeing the need to further develop ISKCON’s outreach. It’s a gap we all need to take responsibility for and help
          fill. We have begun to try new things which have the potential to change what Hare Krishna means to the average person
          and how they engage with Krishna consciousness. For example, Srila Prabhupada said that the next step in ISKCON’s
          development was restaurants – so we started one in London. And like in the old days when there was Chaitanya College, a
          residential retreat place working hand-in-glove with the Manor and Soho Street, we also now need a retreat centre where
          people who come in contact with KC through temples, books, events, courses and restaurants, can go to take their next
          step in their spiritual journey. There are, and will continue to be, many other strategic outreach projects that will
          need our support.
          <br><br>
          We need your help: we need £100,000 per year to develop these strategically critical outreach projects. We can’t plan
          for sustainable future development without this. We want to create restaurants with outreach centres in every major city
          and several more in London. We also want the retreat centre to be the country’s leading residential training and event
          destination for spiritual seekers. And so on…
          <br><br>
          We are looking for individuals who will pledge either £1,000 per year to join our Outreach Patron Programme so that we
          can create this ground-breaking outreach platform and make a real difference to the spiritual lives of the people of
          this country. This is an annual commitment which we hope you will keep renewing as you see the results.
          <br><br>
          So far, almost all our funding has relied on a very small group of individuals giving a lot. For our outreach to really
          flourish in the way Srila Prabhupada desired, we need everyone to contribute at least a small amount. We need you to
          help by becoming an Outreach Patron.
